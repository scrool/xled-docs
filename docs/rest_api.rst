==================================
Twinkly private rest API reference
==================================

Overview
--------

Twinkly rest API is primary way to get information about the device, configure network and modes of the device. It is a HTTP 1.1 based API sent over TCP port 80.

This API is used by mobile applications. It haven't been made public yet so it may change at any time.


HTTP Responses
--------------

The HTTP response can be used to determine if the request was successful, and if not, whether the request should be retried.

200 Success
    The request was successful.

401 Unauthenticated
    Request requires authentication but authorization failed. Application didn't handle the request.


Application responses
---------------------

The API may return application status as `code` value of JSON. Returned will not necessarily "correspond" with the HTTP status code. For example, a HTTP status code 200 OK returned with an error application code indicates that the request successfully reached the server, but application cannot process the request.

1100
    Ok

1101
    Invalid argument value

1102
    Error

1103
    Error - value too long?

1104
    Error - malformed JSON on input?

1105
    Invalid argument key

1107
    Ok?

1108
    Ok?


Authentication
--------------

Most API calls require valid authentication token. Except of:

* login
* gestalt
* fw version

If API requires authentication but valid token wasn't passed server returns HTTP status code 401 Unauthenticated and string `Invalid Token.` in the response body.
